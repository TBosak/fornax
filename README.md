TODO:

Parser - LRU Caching, deterministic & hierarchal ID generation
Router - build on top of Vaadin router for now & create replacement later
Services - add services & Injectable decorator...should there be a base service class?
Should there be a SubscriptionTracker baked into BaseComponent & we unsubscribe on disconnectedCallback?
Implementing standalone components and Angular-like module system? Right now I'm just dumping everything into main.
