TODO:

~~Parser - LRU Caching, deterministic & hierarchal ID generation~~ <br>
~~Router - build on top of Vaadin router for now~~ & create replacement later <br>
Services - add services & Injectable decorator...should there be a base service class? <br>
Should there be a SubscriptionTracker baked into BaseComponent & we unsubscribe on disconnectedCallback? <br>
Implementing standalone components and Angular-like module system? Right now I'm just dumping everything into main.
